To create a migration file for users table
-db-migrate create users db-migrate --sql-file

Solution to why the my server was freezing

- Since my loadLgasTable and loadStatesTable are async functions as oppose to the other middlewares that are synchronous, i should use a 
finally block in my try catch and the finally block should ensure the connection is always released and the next middleware is called.
-which i have done and it works, second option will be to load the loadLgasTable and loadStatesTable before the server starts running
-by adding it as a script in package.json file. So i will chain the commands. 

I tried both methods. Both works. Sticking with the scipt method
